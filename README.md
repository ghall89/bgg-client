A TypeScript client for working with the [BoardGameGeek.com API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2).

> _By using `bgg-client`, you accept BoardGameGeek.com's [XML API Terms of Use](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/XML_API_Terms_of_Use#)._

## Install

```bash
# npm
npm install bgg-client
# pnpm
pnpm add bgg-client
# yarn
yarn add bgg-client
# bun
bun add bgg-client
```

## Usage

Simply import the default `bgg` instance from `bgg-client` â€” a pre-instantiated (singleton) client with built-in rate limiting for the BoardGameGeek API.

If you'd prefer more control â€” for example, to customize rate limits or request behavior â€” you can import the `BoardGameGeekClient` class. For full manual access to any endpoint, you can use the lower-level `ApiClient` class.

By default, there is a rate limit of 1 request every 5 seconds to comply with the BoardGameGeek API's suggested request rate. This can be adjusted by importing and instantiating either the `BoardGameGeekClient` or `ApiClient` classes yourself.
