A TypeScript client for working with the [BoardGameGeek.com API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2).

> _By using `bgg-client`, you accept BoardGameGeek.com's [XML API Terms of Use](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/XML_API_Terms_of_Use#)._

## ðŸ“¦ Install

```bash
# npm
npm install bgg-client
# pnpm
pnpm add bgg-client
# yarn
yarn add bgg-client
# bun
bun add bgg-client
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

Simply import the default `bgg` instance from `bgg-client` â€” a pre-instantiated (singleton) client with built-in rate limiting for the BoardGameGeek API.

If you'd prefer more control â€” for example, to customize rate limits or request behavior â€” you can import the `BoardGameGeekClient` class. For full manual access to any endpoint, you can use the lower-level `ApiClient` class.

By default, there is a rate limit of 1 request every 5 seconds to comply with the BoardGameGeek API's suggested request rate. This can be adjusted by importing and instantiating either the `BoardGameGeekClient` or `ApiClient` classes yourself.

### Methods

**`search(query, options)`**

Calls the `search` endpoint to look up games by name. Returns an array of matching items, including board games, expansions, and other types. Supports options like `type` and `exact`.

**`thing(id, options)`**

Calls the `thing` endpoint to fetch detailed information about a game or item by its BGG ID. Supports options like `stats` to include game statistics.

**`hot(options)`**

Calls the `hot` endpoint to retrieve a list of trending or popular items. You can optionally specify a `type` (e.g., `boardgame`, `rpg`, `boardgameperson`) to filter results.

**`family(id, options)`**

Calls the `family` endpoint to retrieve a "family", and an array of links to related things. You can optionally specify a `type` (e.g., `boardgamefamily`, `rpg`, `rpgperiodical`) to filter results.

### Example

```ts
import bgg from 'bgg-client';

const results = await bgg.search('Cascadia');
const game = await bgg.thing('342942'); // Cascadia's BGG ID
const hot = await bgg.hot();
```

### Additional Endpoints

This package is in active development, and more endpoints will be added over time. Need something like `user`, `collection`, or `plays`? You can access any BGG endpoint manually by importing the `ApiClient` class and using its `getRequest()` method directly.

Refer to the [BGG XML API2 docs](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) for documentation on all endpoints, and their options.
